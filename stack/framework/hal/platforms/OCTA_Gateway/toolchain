# This file tells the cmake system what toolchain is used by the platform
# The only non-outcommented line should be structured as follows:
#   toolchain=<toolchain_name>
# where <toolchain_name> is the name of the required toolchain.
# This does not suffice to guarantee that the correct toolchain is used
# you should also add a 'REQUIRE_TOOLCHAIN(<toolchain_name>) to the 
# CMakeLists.txt file of the platform itself to double check this
